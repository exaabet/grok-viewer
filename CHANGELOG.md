Grok-Viewer 1.2.0:

Added an “Autoplay” toggle in the lightbox to play the next video automatically at the end.
Improved single‑video download so it actually saves the file instead of opening a dead link.
Fixed delete actions so they work reliably again.
Restored the GitHub button and the app logo in the viewer.
Ensured the viewer opens in the correct (incognito or normal) window so each account shows its own videos.
Reconnected the “Purge cache” button so it actually clears and refreshes the list.
