It shows new videos as soon as they are created and loads all existing videos from the Grok Favorites page. Videos are displayed in a clean grid with a lightbox player and keyboard navigation.

The extension works using your active Grok session and focuses only on video content (MP4), ignoring images.

Basic controls include refresh, video playback, and video management actions such as downloading and deleting videos.

**Installation:**  
**Clone or download the repository.**  
**Open Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions.**  
**Enable Developer Mode.**  
**Click “Load unpacked” and select the project directory.**  
**Navigate to Grok Imagine to begin using the extension.**  

Scope and limitations
Grok Viewer is intended for personal use and operates only on content accessible to the logged-in user. The extension does not modify Grok content beyond user-initiated actions such as deletion.
