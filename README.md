Grok Viewer is a simple Chrome extension for viewing and managing MP4 videos generated on Grok Imagine.

It shows new videos as soon as they are created and loads all existing videos from the Grok Favorites page. Videos are displayed in a clean grid with a lightbox player and keyboard navigation.

The extension works using your active Grok session and focuses only on video content (MP4), ignoring images.

Basic controls include refresh, video playback, and video management actions such as downloading and deleting videos.
